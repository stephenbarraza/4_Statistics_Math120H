# What's goin' on here.

Please allow a me a little bit of latitude with this repo.

Inside here you'll find the homework I did for a Statistics class I took a few years back as well as a short research project for the class.  Why set up a repo for this you ask (I'd ask, at least)?

Really, at the time, it was an experiment for myself.  Could I perform all homework lessons in Word using Word's inhouse math symbols?  Let me tell you, it was challenging but I did it!  What I didn't anticipate as a byproduct of the endeavor was that I begin to really formalize my own understanding of the material.  I found it was one thing to take a math class and write down home work assignments in long hand.  It was quite different to type up a homework assignment, in black and white, that your instructor can quickly and easily read and redline.  

So, I was left with these docs that showed how I understood statistics.  If you're looking for perfect statistical understanding, then you might want to move on.  I did get an A in the class but by no means was my understanding perfect.  Still, if you're interested in seeing how I think, how I approach problem solving, then there's some level of value in these docs.  If you happen to grab a copy of the questions in the book (I'm sure they're online) then you'll get the full approach to what was asked of me specifically and then, how I worked through problems, toward solutions.

Cheers!
